Alertness: Digital Watchface for Pebble
=======================================

A simple, clean, digital watchface for [Pebble](https://www.pebble.com/) which is intended to help the wearer be more aware of the passing of time.

Currently, it offers the following:

* Recurring alerts: vibes at a user-specified interval, with a vibe pattern that's sufficiently aggressive that it's hard to ignore. Can be configured for every hour, every 30 mins, every 20 mins, every 15 mins, every 10 mins, every 5 mins, every 3 mins, or _every minute_ (heavens help you). Default is every 15 minutes.
* Quiet time: configurable start and end time for alerts. Default is 9:00am to 10:00pm.
* Displays time and date.
* Displays minutes remaining until next alert.
* Displays battery % remaining. (Can be hidden.)
* Displays bluetooth connection status. (Can be hidden.) 
* Configurable color scheme.
